<!-- <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Mohammed J. Aburidi </h1>	
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Ph.D. Candidate </h3>	--> 


<h5> Welcome to my personal website! </h5>     

<p> I'm Mohammed, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California Merced (UCM), USA. I expect to graduate in August 2024. My primary research interests lie in graph/geometric machine learning and optimization. More specifically, I am investigating the robustness of graph neural networks. I develop convex and non convex optimization based methods to attack and defense GNNs. I also develop optimization methods based on matrix factorization to study drugs and small molecules. <br>     




<p> I completed my master's degree in Applied Mathematics at UCM. Additionally, I hold another master's degree in Scientific Computing from An-Najah National University, along with a bachelor's degree in Physics. My interdisciplinary journey unfolds at the intersection of science and innovation. I apply my methods to unravel the intricacies of proteins, drugs, and small molecules, with the dual goal of expanding knowledge and revolutionizing practical applications. <br>
