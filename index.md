<h1> Mohammed Aburidi </h1>	
<h2> Ph.D. Candidate </h2>	
<p> DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS <br>
<p> 5200 NORTH LAKE ROAD; MERCED, CA 95343<br>



<h3>Hello! </h3>	

<p> Greetings! I am Mohammed, a passionate and perpetual seeker of knowledge, navigating the intricate realms of academia as a Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious University of California Merced (UCM) in sunny California, USA. <br>

<p> In the hallowed halls of UCM, I delve into the fascinating intersections of graph/geometric machine learning and optimization, pushing the boundaries of understanding and application. My academic journey is intricately woven with a profound focus on Optimal Transport (OT) theory, where I leverage its power for the nuanced realm of metric learning. <br>

<p> At the heart of my academic pursuits lies the development of cutting-edge solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. I spearhead this mission through the ingenious application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based solvers, pioneering transformative approaches to problem-solving that transcend conventional boundaries. <br>

<p> At UCM, I worked with Professor Roummel Marcia, I passionately immerse myself in unraveling the mysteries of proteins, drugs, and small molecules. My work not only adds to the tapestry of scientific knowledge but also holds the promise of practical applications with far-reaching implications. <br>

<p> I completed a master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of California Merced, setting the stage for a trajectory defined by excellence. Prior to this, I earned a first master's degree in Scientific Computing from An-Najah National University in the historic city of Nablus, Palestine. My academic foundation was laid with a bachelor's degree in Physics, providing me with a holistic understanding that forms the bedrock of my interdisciplinary approach. <br>

<p> As I traverse the intricate landscapes of academia, my insatiable curiosity continues to drive me forward. I am not merely a scholar; I am a torchbearer of innovation, seeking not only to understand the complexities of our world but to redefine them through transformative research. <br>

<p> Join me on this exhilarating journey of discovery, where each question posed opens the door to new realms of knowledge, and every challenge is an opportunity to redefine what is possible. Together, let us venture into the uncharted territories of science and make a lasting impact on the world.
